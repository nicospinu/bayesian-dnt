# Bayesian modelling of developmental neurotoxicity

### About this repository
It includes the electronic materials, i.e., the scripts and data used to train the model. The model predicted the probability that a compound induces each of three selected common key events (CKEs) of the simplified Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network and the adverse outcome (AO) of developmental neurotoxicity (DNT), taking into account correlations and causal relations informed by the key event relationships (KERs).
